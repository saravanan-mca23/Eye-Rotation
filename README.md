This Project has two eyes which follow the mouse movement .Both the eyes are synhronised to follow the direction of the mouse pointer. It looks like a person following the mouse. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events.
## Steps to Run the project
